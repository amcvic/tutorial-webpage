          <h1>Functions</h1>
          <h3>Segments of code that do a specified task</h3>

        <p>
          <pre><code class="javascript">
          //This function returns the sum of x and y
          function add(x, y) {
            return x + y;
          }
          //This is an invocation of the function that will return the sum of 5 and 6, 11.
          function(5, 6);
          </code></pre>
          Functions are very useful chunks of code that contain a series of instructions that you can invoke as many times as you want.
          A Function starts out with a "function" declaration, followed by the name of your function (can be named anything that is not a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp">reserved word</a>) and takes in optional parameters, (in this case, x & y), that you can then use inside your function.
          Functions sometimes return values depending on what you want it to do, in this example we return the sum of x and y.
          In order to call the function, you simply write the name of your function with parentheses, and inside the parentheses pass the necessary arguments. In our example we pass 5 and 6 to the function so that we can get our desired sum of 11.<br><br>

          <h1>Objects</h1>
          <h3>Special variable that holds information regarding a set thing</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          <pre><code class="javascript">
            //Example object of a student named John Smith
            let student = {
              firstName : "John",
              lastName  : "Smith",    
              id        : 500000783,
              age       : 17,
              schedule  : ["art", "history", "science", "math"]
            };
            //Example for accessing the value for the key "id"
            student.id;
          </code></pre>
          An object is a container for a thing that can hold many properties and even methods. Defining objects is as simple as defining a variable, but in this case we use curly braces to hold all of our object's properties.
          An object property can be any kind of variable, be it a string, number, boolean, array, or even another object.
          In our example, we have two string properties, (first and last names), two numbers, (id and age), and an array containing this student's class schedule.
          The properties are in what we call a "key-value pair". This essentially means that the name of the variable is the "key" and the contents of the varialbe is the "value".
          In order to access the value of a specified key, we use what is known as "dot-notation", in which we write the object name, followed by a period followed by the key we want to access. <br><br>

          <h1>Conditionals</h1>
          <h3>A statement that evaluates to true or false</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          <pre><code class="javascript">
            //Example that checks the time of day and gives a relevant greeting
            let time = 0800;
            if (time < 1100) {
              console.log('good morning');
            } else if (time < 2000) {
              console.log('good day');
            } else {
              console.log('good evening');
            }
          </code></pre>
          Conditionals are statements that will execute a block of code if the given statement evaluates to true.
          This is useful for the branching points of your program, if you want specific things to happen under specific circumstances.
          To perform an conditional statement, you write "if" followed by your condition in parentheses. Next, in curly braces, you write the block of code that you want to be run.
          Following that, if there are other statements you want it to check for, you write "else if" followed by another conditional statement.
          Finally, if you would like a default case should none of those statements evaluate to true, you write "else" and then your code block.
          In the example above, since the time is 0800, the message that will be written is 'good morning' since 0800 is less than 1100. <br> <br>
